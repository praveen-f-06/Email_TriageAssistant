Methodology Problem Definition Email inboxes often contain long and repetitive conversation threads that prevent users from quickly identifying important messages. Manually reviewing these threads increases cognitive load and leads to missed deadlines and delayed responses.

Traditional email filtering systems rely on basic rules or keywords and lack full conversational understanding.

Design Approach The Email Triage Assistant is designed around the idea of context reduction before analysis. By applying ScaleDown compression to email threads, the system preserves intent while minimizing the amount of data processed.

This approach enables full-context understanding with lower cost and faster performance.

Implementation Strategy Collect raw email thread data Apply ScaleDown compression to reduce context size Analyze compressed summaries Categorize emails based on intent Assign priority levels Generate reply draft suggestions Present results through a simple interface Role of ScaleDown ScaleDown plays a critical role in the system by:

Reducing email thread size by up to 80% Preserving semantic meaning and urgency signals Enabling efficient full-thread analysis Lowering processing latency and token usage Evaluation Metrics The system is evaluated based on:

Context reduction percentage Accuracy of email categorization Effectiveness of priority scoring Quality of generated summaries and replies Methodology Benefits Faster inbox triage Reduced email overload Improved response efficiency Scalable and cost-efficient processing Summary This methodology demonstrates how intelligent compression using ScaleDown can significantly improve the performance and usability of AI-powered email management systems while maintaining full conversational context.
